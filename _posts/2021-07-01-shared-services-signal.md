## Introduction

We helped an organisation take advantage of cloud services, and where the service was available and accepted it has worked great. Where one of those is not trye, we ended up with some internal service wrapping up cloud services plus package installs and so on. These services quickly started to look old school. Even though similar customer facing product engineering teams with similar team members managed to be more obviously successful in engineering great product services.  We started to ask, is it possible that Internal Services Don't Work?
